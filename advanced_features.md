# Advanced Features for DC 180 Motor Drone

This document explains the advanced features implemented in the drone control system to enhance stability, safety, and performance.

## Complementary Filtering

The drone now uses a complementary filter to combine gyroscope and accelerometer data for more accurate angle estimation:

```arduino
// Apply complementary filter for more stable angle estimation
filtered_roll = GYRO_WEIGHT * gyro_roll_input + ACCEL_WEIGHT * accel_roll;
filtered_pitch = GYRO_WEIGHT * gyro_pitch_input + ACCEL_WEIGHT * accel_pitch;
```

This provides several benefits:
- Reduces drift that occurs with gyroscope-only measurements
- Filters out accelerometer noise during rapid movements
- Provides more stable angle readings for better flight control
- Improves hovering stability

## Emergency Landing System

A new safety feature that initiates a controlled descent when:
- Connection to the remote control is lost
- The drone exceeds maximum safe tilt angles (25 degrees)
- Battery reaches critical levels

During emergency landing:
- The drone gradually reduces throttle at a controlled rate
- All control inputs are neutralized to keep the drone level
- The drone disarms automatically after landing

## Motor Synchronization and Balancing

The system now monitors motor outputs and automatically adjusts PID parameters if significant imbalances are detected:

```arduino
// Periodically check and balance motor outputs
if (motors_armed && millis() - motor_sync_timer > MOTOR_SYNC_INTERVAL) {
  motor_sync_timer = millis();
  balance_motors();
}
```

This helps with:
- Compensating for minor differences between motors
- Adapting to changing flight conditions
- Preventing oscillations caused by aggressive PID values
- Improving overall flight stability

## Motor Test Mode

A new diagnostic feature that allows testing each motor individually:
1. While disarmed, hold the calibrate switch for 3 seconds
2. Each motor will activate in sequence for 2 seconds
3. LED blinks indicate which motor is being tested
4. Test ends automatically or when arm switch is toggled

This helps with:
- Verifying all motors are working correctly
- Identifying which motor is which (front-left, front-right, etc.)
- Testing motor response without arming the drone
- Diagnosing motor or ESC issues

## Auto-Leveling System

The drone now features an auto-leveling system that:
- Uses filtered angle data for more stable hovering
- Automatically returns to level when controls are released
- Prevents excessive tilt angles for safer flight
- Can be disabled for more aggressive maneuvers

## Usage Tips

1. **Motor Testing**: Before flight, use the motor test mode to verify all motors are working correctly.

2. **Calibration**: Always calibrate the gyroscope on a level surface before flying.

3. **Emergency Recovery**: If the drone becomes unstable, release all controls and reduce throttle - the auto-leveling system will attempt to stabilize.

4. **PID Tuning**: If you notice oscillations, reduce the P and D gain values in the code.

5. **Battery Management**: The voltage compensation system works best with a fully charged battery.

## Troubleshooting

- **Drone drifts in one direction**: Recalibrate the gyroscope on a perfectly level surface.

- **Motors spin unevenly**: Run the motor test to identify any weak motors that may need replacement.

- **Unstable flight**: Check propeller balance and ensure the drone's weight is evenly distributed.

- **Emergency landing activates too often**: Adjust the MAX_ANGLE_LIMIT parameter to a higher value (not recommended for beginners).

- **Sudden disarming during flight**: Check battery voltage and ensure the connection to the remote is stable.
